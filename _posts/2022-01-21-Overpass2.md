## Premise

Overpass has been hacked and we need to find out what happened with the provided PCAP file. 

## Wireshark forensics

We can analyse the file in Wireshark. I usually start with checking the **Statistics > Protocol Hierarchy** to get an idea what we are working with.

Then applied http as filter  

[![wireshark](/assets/img/overpass2/wireshark-http.jpg)](/assets/img/overpass2/wireshark-http.jpg)

We can see the page hacker used to upload a payload.

If we look at the packet 6, we can also see that the developers had acknowledged in a comment that this site is insecure...  

[![wireshark](/assets/img/overpass2/wireshark-site-comment.jpg)](/assets/img/overpass2/wireshark-site-comment.jpg)

Well damage has already happened so let's continue and follow TCP stream of the payload upload. 

In the stream we can see the payload that hacker used to get a reverse-shell.

[![tcp-stream](/assets/img/overpass2/wireshark-tcp-stream.jpg)](/assets/img/overpass2/wireshark-tcp-stream.jpg)

Now we can use the reverse-shell port as a filter `tcp.port == PORT` to find out what the attacker did. We need to follow the TCP stream again and now we can see everything the attacker did when connecting with reverse-shell, because netcat reverse-shell traffic is not encrypted.  

[![tcp-stream2](/assets/img/overpass2/wireshark-tcp-stream2.jpg)](/assets/img/overpass2/wireshark-tcp-stream2.jpg)

We can see the password attacker used, we can see attacker checked the **/etc/shadow** and probably tried to crack the hashes to get other accounts passwords. Also we can see how the attacker established persistence. 

[![persistence](/assets/img/overpass2/wireshark-persistence.jpg)](/assets/img/overpass2/wireshark-persistence.jpg)

We can also copy the **/etc/shadow** password hashes and try to crack them. I used John the Ripper for this.  

    john hashes -w=/usr/share/wordlists/fasttrack.txt

<br />

## Research code

We can check the repo that attacker used. In the code we can see that it used to make a backdoor with ssh using port 2222. There is also hardcoded default hash and salt for the backdoor.

[![salt](/assets/img/overpass2/salt.png)](/assets/img/overpass2/salt.png)

On the TCP stream we can see that attacker used different hash to build their backdoor.

We can try to crack this and hopefully use it their backdoor to get back into the Overpass' production server. This time I used hashcat with rockyou.txt for the cracking. From the sourcecode we know the hashes are salted sha512 so we use mode 1710.

    hashcat -m 1710 hash:salt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

<br />

## Hacking back into server

Before hacking back into server I wanted to see what modifications the hacker had done to the Overpass website. If I had just used CURL I would have missed this cute creature :3

[![hacked-site](/assets/img/overpass2/hacked-site.png)](/assets/img/overpass2/hacked-site.png)

We know attacker used account james and made a ssh-backdoor using port 2222 and the password we just cracked. With this info we can try to login as james.  

[![ssh-as-james](/assets/img/overpass2/ssh-james.png)](/assets/img/overpass2/ssh-james.png)

Now we can read the user flag from the **/home/james/user.txt**

Then we need to find some way to escalate privileges. Tried to find some SUID that we could use. 

    find / -type f -perm -04000 -ls 2>/dev/nul

There is one interesting result  

[![SUID](/assets/img/overpass2/suid.png)](/assets/img/overpass2/suid.png)

Tried to run this suid_bash, but ended up getting a bash shell with james  

[![suid-bash](/assets/img/overpass2/suid-bash.png)](/assets/img/overpass2/suid-bash.png)

After some research with **man bash** I found out that a flag is needed so that it will run as root

[![man-bash](/assets/img/overpass2/man-bash.png)](/assets/img/overpass2/man-bash.png)

Running suid_bash with flag `-p`  

[![root-bash](/assets/img/overpass2/suid-bash-root.png)](/assets/img/overpass2/suid-bash-root.png)

Now we can read the root flag from the **/root/root.txt**

### Comments

I've been thinking for a while to start making writeups and not only notes for me. I really enjoyed this room so I decided that this will become my first writeup.
